# Overview

This is a program written in Rust that gets a string input from the user to either encrypt or decrypt. The user also provides the "secret key". The key is used to shift the alphabetical characters in the string, thus "encrypting" it.

I created this project to learn about Rust. It makes use of functions, variable references, loops, and basic error checking.

# Future Work

There are several features I would like to add in the future.

- Support for full file encryption and decryption
- Ability to read/write text from files
